            The past and the future collide on the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E, which is inspired by the automaker's unmistakable pony car and powered exclusively by electricity.
            Although it shares a name and familiar styling cues with the Mustang, the all-electric crossover otherwise is completely unrelated.
            With two available battery sizes and either rear- or all-wheel drive, Ford says the Mach-E can provide up to 305 miles of driving range, which helped it earn an Editors' Choice award.
            Its five-passenger cabin is fitted with contemporary features and cutting-edge infotainment options as well as some unique cargo and storage solutions.
            While purists might call an electric Mustang crossover sacrilegious, Ford expects the name and design adaptation to increase interest and help sell a lot of copies of the 2021 Mach-E.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>
            The 2021 Mustang Mach-E is available with either a standard-range 75.7 kWh (68 of which are usable) battery or an extended-range 98.8 kWh (88 are usable) pack.
            These feed an electric motor mounted on the rear or both axles. That latter combination creates all-wheel drive and on the sporty GT and GT Performance models, the motors combine to make 480 horsepower and up to 634 pound-feet of torque.
            Ford claims this will send the Mach-E GT Performance from zero to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds.
            Less powerful models make between 266 and 346 horses and between 317 and 428 pound-feet.</p>

          <div class="description">
            <p>
            The 2021 Mustang Mach-E has an EPA-estimated range of between 211 and 305 miles, depending on the battery pack and type of electric motors, which isn't nearly as impressive as the rangiest Tesla models.
            Every model also has fast-charging capability. Every Mach-E comes out of the box with a Ford mobile charger that can add up to 30 miles of range per night with a 120-volt outlet and up to 80 percent of battery life overnight with a 240-volt outlet.
            A Ford charge station can also be ordered online and installed by certified electricians, with the ability to replenish 32 miles per hour and recharge the battery overnight.</p>

            The Mustang Mach-Eâ€™s battery is located under the floor of the car, which allows for maximum cargo and passenger space. Unlike its exterior, the inside of the Mach-E has little in common with the regular Mustang.
            Its streamlined dashboard hosts an attractive digital gauge cluster and is dominated by a huge vertically mounted touchscreen. A floating, flip-up armrest on the center console allows a purse or other items to be stored between the front-seat passengers.
            There are also many slick features that include customizable ambient interior lighting, heated front seats, a heated steering wheel, wireless charging, a panoramic sunroof, and more.
            The front trunk is made of durable plastics that can be rinsed and then drained, which allows storing ice and messy things. The Mach-E has 29 cubic feet of cargo space behind the rear seats, and up to 60 with the back seats folded.</p>
